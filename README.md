# android_image_analysis_openCV

It is a sample work with Image Analyis using OpenCV at Android OS. For now, it uses the camera of a mobile phone and processes images in real time.

When to install it, make sure that you have opencv library and they are linked via CMakeLists.txt

If you would like to install the application, [the APK is avaliable in the repo](https://github.com/dekespo/android_image_analysis_openCV/blob/master/dekespo_opencv_imageAnalysis.apk) . Please download it into your Android mobile phone and run the APK file; it should need permission to access only your camera. Once it is installed, it will ask you for the permission and afterwards if the phone closes the app for some reason, open the app again and it should be working.

If you would like to start from stracth, you could follow the instructions from [here](https://github.com/leadrien/opencv_native_androidstudio).
